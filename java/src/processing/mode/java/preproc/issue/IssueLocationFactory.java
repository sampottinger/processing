 * Utility that can help clean up where in source an issue should be reported.

 *    For some errors, the location of the "mistake" does not appear close to where the actual error
 *    is generated. For example, consider omitting a semicolon. Though the "mistake" is arguably on
 *    the line on which a semicolon is forgotten, the grammatical error appears in the first
 *    non-skip token after the omitted character. This means that the issue shown to the user may
 *    be far away from the line they would want to edit. This utility helps determine if an issue
 *    requires a new location and, if so, where the location should be.
